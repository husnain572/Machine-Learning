    "### Algorithm:\n",
    "A set of rules or instructions given to an AI system to help it learn from data.\n",
    "Example: Decision tree is an algorithm used for classification and regression tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training Data:\n",
    "The dataset used to train the machine learning model. It's data for supervised learning.\n",
    "Example: A set of images of cats and dogs, each labeled \"cat\" or \"dog\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Testing Data:\n",
    "Data used to evaluate the performance of the model after training. It's unseen by the model during training.\n",
    "Example: A new set of images not included in the training data, used to check the accuracy of a trained model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Features:\n",
    "Individual measurable properties or characteristics of a phenomenon being observed, used as input variables in a model.\n",
    "Example: In a dataset of house price prediction, features might include square footage, number of bedrooms, and age of the house.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Labels:\n",
    "The output generated by a model is referred to as labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model:\n",
    "In machine learning, a model refers to the specific representation learned from data, based on which predictions or decisions are made.\n",
    "Example: A neural network trained to identify objects in images.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overfitting:\n",
    "A modeling error that occurs when a model is too complex and learns the noise and details in the training data to the extent that it negatively impacts the performance of the model on new data.\n",
    "Example: A model that performs exceptionally well on the training data but poorly on the testing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Underfitting:\n",
    "This occurs when a model is too simple, unable to capture the underlying patterns of the data and therefore performs poorly on both training and new data.\n",
    "Example: A linear regression model trying to fit non-linear data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Python Libraries:\n",
    "1. Scikit-learn\n",
    "2. TensorFlow\n",
    "3. Keras\n",
    "4. PyTorch\n",
    "5. NLTK\n",
    "6. OpenCV\n"
